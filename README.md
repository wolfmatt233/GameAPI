## Project Details

This is a single page web application that integrates an API. The purpose of the application is to display a list of video games. Users can create an account and log in, thereby allowing them to like and review games, add games to favorites, and mark games as played or "to play". There is a heavy focus on C.R.U.D. design and content injection. This application will use firebase as a NOSQL storage option.
